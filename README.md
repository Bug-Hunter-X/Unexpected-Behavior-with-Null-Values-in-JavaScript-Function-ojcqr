This repository contains a simple JavaScript program that demonstrates a common error when handling null values. The `foo` function adds two numbers; however, if either number is null, it returns 0 instead of handling the null value appropriately. The solution demonstrates a corrected version of the function that returns null if either input is null. This example highlights the importance of proper null handling to avoid unexpected behavior and maintain program robustness.
